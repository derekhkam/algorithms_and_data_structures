First, because numpy is implemented at a lower programming level compared with Python's standard set functions, using numpy, specifically np.setdiff1d(), might result in a faster execution. Second, the code may be made more flexible and with less lines by using a recursive function. This will include a base case for stopping where start > end of the given range, checking that \"start\" exists in the given list (if not, append \"start\" to the return list), and recurse at start + 1. This will however increase the time complexity to O(n), i.e. n number of steps during recursion, and worse case to O(n^2), with the backend list operations.\n",

    "Although I started looking at Q2 from a mathematical point of view, i.e. trying to exhaust the possible paths, I gradually realized that rather than using an algebraic formula that iterates over the possibilities, it would be easier to trace all the paths from nodes to nodes. At that point, I determined that the after defining a node object, the next step is to define a function to convert any list to a binary tree. Using a recursive defining structure, I followed the logic of preorder traversal (which can be used to copy trees). The difficult part, where I had to trial-and-error for quite many times, was to create one list for each path. The final solution I found was to create a shallow copy at each branching.\n",

    "In terms of reviewing my partnerâ€™s answer to A3, I very much appreciated the simplicity with which she approached the problem. The main algorithm is a subtraction of two sets and the code is very clean overall. Therefore, I thought in the direction of alternative approaches that could improve performance and flexibility. For performance, using numpy, which operates at a lower level than Python, might help to improve speed. For flexibility, the code could in fact be written recursively, by comparing each integer with a numpy array. While increasing time complexity, this approach may be useful in case further steps or requirements are to be included. "
